# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 6, 2021 

**Today's Progress**:

**Day 1 - What I have learned today**
Learned about printing, how to solve errors (Google)
Using backslash - (\n) to use the next line inside the print statement.
Input function - needs to have in variable so that the value can be stored inside the variable.
Thonny - A software that will explain step by step, line by line of the code for a detailed explanation.
Basic Data Types - String, Integer, Float, Boolean
Subscript - Pulling out a particular element from a string. “Hello”[0]
Type check - type() it will show type of data

*PEMDAS priority* - 
- Parentheses ()
- Exponents **
- Multiplication *
- Division /
- Addition +
- Subtraction -

Round function - round(45.56, 2) or Format function "{:.2f}".format(int)
- f-String - print(f”Hello {variable}”)
- Avoid float - Using // gets the whole number

### Day 2: September 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Comparision operators:*
- Greater than >
- Less than <
- Greater than equal to >=
- Less than equal to <=
- Not equal to !=
- Equal to ==

#Modulo operator %
- Gives the remainder
- If 4/x2 is = 2 which gives no remainder than it is even number.
- if 4/3 is = 3 x 1 + 1 which gives 1 as a remainder than it is odd number.

#Multiple if statements
- Nested if statement (Like an inception)

*Solving if else questions is easier when we prepare a flow chart. Create either on paper first or at draw.io website.*

#Logical Operators -
- AND, OR and NOT

**Thoughts**: Initially the project questions were difficult but after examining it again and again and later taking a break for a while and then coming up with step by step procedure, did the solution came correctly and code executed smoothly. Really when you get stuck, all you need it just take a break and come back later and you will have step by step solution on your own.

---------------------------------------

### Day 3: September 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
Random Module and Python Lists
- random.int and many more can be found from AskPython document.
- List can have append, replace etc
- nested list: list inside list

Had fun doing few projects mixing with random module, lists, conditional operators and if-elif-else statement combinations.

**Thoughts**: Still needs to polish random module, other than that had fun creating Rock, paper, scissor game.

---------------------------------------

### Day 4: September 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- For Loop
- range 
- random.choice, random.shuffle

First two questions were easy to solve using all the previous lessons and for the last part of question 
I was not able to come to terms so I looked into the solution and then it did make sense

**Thoughts**: Will still come back to it and work on it again and try to make sense.

### Day 5: September 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Functions.
- Code Blocks
- While Loops
- Indentation

**Thoughts**: While I have understood how while loop works, but still needed to practice again and again with if-elif-else type of problems.

---------------------------------------

### Day 6: September 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Hangman Game
- While Loop
- Range 
- Module

For Module importing, we can also import like *import this* and then add *this.somethinginside*

**Thoughts**: While loop can be scary. So condition has to be met if we want to use while loop. Other than that, had fun getting along with the 
hangman guess game. Breaking down the problems and doing step by step and taking few breaks here and there is the best way to complete the project.

---------------------------------------

### Day 7: September 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Functions and its Parameters and Arguments

* *Functions Parameter* - The parameter is the name of data that's being passed in.
* *Functions Arugments* - The argument is the actual value of the data.
* *Functions Keyword Arguments* - Assigning the parameter value inside the function bracket itself. So that it can be placed anywhere and to not 
worry about Positional Arguments.
* For Example - greet(name = "Kuldeep", location = "Mumbai")
Where as name and location is parameter and inside the double quotes is Arguments. 

* Import math function - If there is the need to round up the decimal number we can also use math.ceil() by importing math.

**Thoughts**: Practicing while learning the course video is good and motivating.

---------------------------------------
### Day 8: September 13th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Dictionaries - Key and Value
- Nested List - List inside List
- Nested Dictionaries - Dictionary inside a list

**Thoughts**: Complicated to understand the structer if included list and dictionary inside the dictionary or list but by writing clean code it will
be easy to read and understand. Using pythontutor .com can also help decoding each line to understand better.

---------------------------------------
### Day 9: September 14th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Functions and Output
- Print vs return
- how to write comment for user defined functions

**Thoughts**: Created a calculator code along with the help of the intructor and the explaination was good. Main thing was how to be careful using while loop and inside it calling the function within a function to avoid function to go infinte loops.

---------------------------------------
### Day 10: September 15th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Basic HTML & HTML 5
- a href tag, img src tag
- ul and ol tag
- form tag, button tag

**Thoughts**: Did not feel like doing python today so headed over freecodecamp website and started with html and html5 basics and completed 70% of its course.

---------------------------------------
### Day 11: September 16th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Completed Basic HTML & HTML 5
- Started with basic CSS
- Scope in Python 
  - Local Scope which exists within functions.
  - Global Scope which exists outside functions and is available anywhere with the file because its define at the top/start of the function.
- Scope also applies to functions and anything else which is known as Namespace.
- GLOBAL variable in capital letters

### Points to remember:
- we can use "<!-- -->" to comment out in HTML.
- uses "style" tag to change color, font size font type etc so it would be applied to whole instead of changing it inside h2 tag or p tag.
- "<label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>" for radio type option
- "checkbox" for checkbox type options
- "<input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required> <button type="submit">Submit</button>" for button and inside it placeholder text.
- Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element using its class attribute, by separating each class name with a space. 
- Define a class in style tag using period and then declare that class in h2 or p or div tag wherever required.
- Note that inside your style element, you always reference classes by putting a . in front of their names. 
- You always reference ids by putting a # in front of their names.  
- Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: padding, border, and margin.
- Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties individually, you can specify them all in one line.


**Thoughts**: CSS feels nice but are detailed. Python needs practice.

---------------------------------------
### Day 12: September 17th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Basic CSS completed
- Python debugging tips

**Thoughts**: Started with CSS completed it and then started with python course which showed us about how to read or debug the code in case of errors.

---------------------------------------
### Day 13: September 18th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Visual Design HTML completed half
- Did practice Python game from the course

**Thoughts**: Started with Visual design from freecodecamp completed it 50% and then started with python course which showed one game to create from scratch. I started with it and then eventually needed help in figuring out how to print key value of dictionary nested inside list.

---------------------------------------
### Day 14: September 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

---------------------------------------
### Day 16: September 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Visual Accessibility completed 100%

**Thoughts**: Started with Visual accessibility from freecodecamp completed 100% it and did not work with python today.
