# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 6, 2021 

**Today's Progress**:

**Day 1 - What I have learned today**
Learned about printing, how to solve errors (Google)
Using backslash - (\n) to use the next line inside the print statement.
Input function - needs to have in variable so that the value can be stored inside the variable.
Thonny - A software that will explain step by step, line by line of the code for a detailed explanation.
Basic Data Types - String, Integer, Float, Boolean
Subscript - Pulling out a particular element from a string. “Hello”[0]
Type check - type() it will show type of data

*PEMDAS priority* - 
- Parentheses ()
- Exponents **
- Multiplication *
- Division /
- Addition +
- Subtraction -

Round function - round(45.56, 2) or Format function "{:.2f}".format(int)
- f-String - print(f”Hello {variable}”)
- Avoid float - Using // gets the whole number

### Day 2: September 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Comparision operators:*
- Greater than >
- Less than <
- Greater than equal to >=
- Less than equal to <=
- Not equal to !=
- Equal to ==

#Modulo operator %
- Gives the remainder
- If 4/x2 is = 2 which gives no remainder than it is even number.
- if 4/3 is = 3 x 1 + 1 which gives 1 as a remainder than it is odd number.

#Multiple if statements
- Nested if statement (Like an inception)

*Solving if else questions is easier when we prepare a flow chart. Create either on paper first or at draw.io website.*

#Logical Operators -
- AND, OR and NOT

**Thoughts**: Initially the project questions were difficult but after examining it again and again and later taking a break for a while and then coming up with step by step procedure, did the solution came correctly and code executed smoothly. Really when you get stuck, all you need it just take a break and come back later and you will have step by step solution on your own.

### Day 3: September 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
Random Module and Python Lists
- random.int and many more can be found from AskPython document.
- List can have append, replace etc
- nested list: list inside list

Had fun doing few projects mixing with random module, lists, conditional operators and if-elif-else statement combinations.

**Thoughts**: Still needs to polish random module, other than that had fun creating Rock, paper, scissor game.

### Day 4: September 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- For Loop
- range 
- random.choice, random.shuffle

First two questions were easy to solve using all the previous lessons and for the last part of question 
I was not able to come to terms so I looked into the solution and then it did make sense

**Thoughts**: Will still come back to it and work on it again and try to make sense.

### Day 5: September 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Functions.
- Code Blocks
- While Loops
- Indentation

**Thoughts**: While I have understood how while loop works, but still needed to practice again and again with if-elif-else type of problems.

### Day 6: September 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Hangman Game
- While Loop
- Range 
- Module

For Module importing, we can also import like *import this* and then add *this.somethinginside*

**Thoughts**: While loop can be scary. So condition has to be met if we want to use while loop. Other than that, had fun getting along with the 
hangman guess game. Breaking down the problems and doing step by step and taking few breaks here and there is the best way to complete the project.

---------------------------------------

### Day 7: September 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Functions and its Parameters and Arguments

* *Functions Parameter* - The parameter is the name of data that's being passed in.
* *Functions Arugments* - The argument is the actual value of the data.
* *Functions Keyword Arguments* - Assigning the parameter value inside the function bracket itself. So that it can be placed anywhere and to not 
worry about Positional Arguments.
* For Example - greet(name = "Kuldeep", location = "Mumbai")
Where as name and location is parameter and inside the double quotes is Arguments. 

* Import math function - If there is the need to round up the decimal number we can also use math.ceil() by importing math.

**Thoughts**: Practicing while learning the course video is good and motivating.

---------------------------------------
### Day 8: September 13th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Dictionaries - Key and Value
- Nested List - List inside List
- Nested Dictionaries - Dictionary inside a list

**Thoughts**: Complicated to understand the structer if included list and dictionary inside the dictionary or list but by writing clean code it will
be easy to read and understand. Using pythontutor .com can also help decoding each line to understand better.
